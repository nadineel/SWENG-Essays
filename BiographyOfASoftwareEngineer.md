Biography of a Software Engineer

## James Gosling


#### Introduction
This essay is on a biography of a key software engineer, discussing the work and impact of the individual. It took me quite some time to think of someone who fits this description. I know we have Bill Gates, Linus Torvalds, Sundar Pichai and a lot more prominent people with outstanding achievements. Then I looked at the prompt and saw the second half “impact of the individual”. I thought to myself, well the very first computer science related thing I learned was Java, my first ever computer program was Java, so I decided to take this opportunity to learn more about its origin. Hence, my essay will be on James Gosling, the founder and lead designer of behind Java programming language.


#### Background
James A. Gosling, O.C., Ph.D. also known as Dr. Java, was born on May 19, 1955 near Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
 
He received a B.Sc in Computer Science from the University of Calgary in 1977, then earned his Ph.D in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1983 where he did his doctoral thesis "The Algebraic Manipulation of Constraints." While working towards his doctorate, he wrote a version of emacs (gosmacs), and he also worked on developing multiprocessor version of the operating system UNIX, and several compilers as well as mail systems.
 
Since 1984, Gosling has been with Sun Microsystems, and is generally known best as the founder of the Java programming language.
 
He was credited as the inventor of the Java programming language in 1991. He did the original design of Java and implemented its original compiler and virtual machine. Because of this, he was elected to the United States National Academy of Engineering. In addition, he has made major contributions to several other software systems, such as NeWS and Gosling Emacs. He also cowrote a utility thoroughly detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike's book The Unix Programming Environment called the "bundle" program.


#### Java
Before Java, C++ dominated the programming world which incorporated several OOP concepts and looked perfect at that time. It was realised later on C++ is compatible to program only on specific set of devices, as it is platform dependent. This caveat of C++ James’ motivation on creating a platform independent language which could be used by a lot more devices other than computers. 
Along with his colleagues, James started working towards the development of this language in the year 1991. It took 18 months for James to develop the first working version of the language. It was initially named as "OAK" and later in the year of 1995 it was forever named as "JAVA". James has invented the authentic layout of Java as well as the compiler and virtual machine. 
Java as we all know is a language with a huge scope. Because of its simplicity, it is no wonder a lot of schools decide to teach Java in first year.  
#### NeWs
Originally known as “SunDew,” Network extensible Window System(NeWs) is a discontinued extensible window system that was developed at SUN where James previously worked at. One of its goals was to provide a clean programmer interface where it completely hides window damage from the programmer. NeWs was an elegant Postscript-based windowing environment for Unix especially Sun workstations, designed primarily by James Gosling. 

#### Gosling Emacs
Often known as "Gosmacs" or "gmacs," Gosling Emacs is a discontinued Emacs implementation written in 1981 by James Gosling in C. Its extension language, Mocklisp, has a syntax that appears like Lisp, but Mocklisp does not have lists or any other structured datatypes. Initially, he allowed gmacs to be redistributed with no formal restrictions, but later sold it to UniPress.


#### Awards
•	2002: awarded "THE ECONOMIST" Innovation Award and "The Lifetime Achievement Awards" by Flame. 
•	2007: awarded "Officer of the Order of Canada". 
•	2013: became one of the fellows for Computing Advances that are Transforming Science and Society from The Association for Computing Machinery
•	2015: awarded "IEEE John von Neumann Medal"
•	2019: named Computer History fellow

#### My thoughts
Java’s development without a doubt changed internet forever. For the conception, design, and implementation of the Java programming language, James Gosling has certainly made a huge impact not just to me, and everyone but also to the future.

There must be something about 1955 as a lot of great and successful tech figures were born that year. Here is an image of data sample of software millionaires’ birth year. Although James Gosling is not included in the data, I think this is an interesting finding, so I added it here.

[This is also a good read where James Gosling talked about how he was treated in Oracle after Sun Microsystems took a hit financially.](https://www.eweek.com/development/java-creator-james-gosling-why-i-quit-oracle/)
